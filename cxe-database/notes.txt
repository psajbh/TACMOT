1. create a database.
	a. login: mysql -u root -p  {then enter user root password}
		// you don't have to be root, you can be any user that has create grants.
		note:  access mysql like - C:\Users\John> cd ..\..\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
		
	b. mysql> create database cxe_{name};  //drop database cxe_jhart
	   Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
	
2. populate new database with tables, etc..  This can be done with maven via console, maven via eclipse or bash files. 

	a. navigate to location of flyway project
		i.e. C:\dev\projects\github-projects\TACMOT\cxe-database
		
	b. run flyway:
		i.e. mvn flyway:migrate -e
		.....
		INFO] Successfully applied 629 migrations to schema `cxe_jhart` (execution time 01:24.029s).
		[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
		[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

3. repeatable migrations.  These are migrations that will be executed with every run.
  
	a. Developers must take caution in ensuring there are no conflicts. Make sure a record is deleted before 
		inserting a new record, etc.
		
	b. These migrations start with a R__ vice a V.
	
4.  if you migrate via a bash file, insure to run user_mapping.sh before executing.

5.  anytime changes are made, i.e. add another version migration, or change a repeating migration you need to run a clean install on the project.

6.  To remove everything and start over, recommend using drop, create database vice using flyway:clean goal.
