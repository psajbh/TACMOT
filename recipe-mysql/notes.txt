recipe-mysql built from the sfg-recipe branch sfg-recipe-h2

This branch will run sfg-recipe using default, dev or prod profiles. The default profile 
runs on the H2 database.  Dev runs the sfg_dev schema on mysql.  Prd runs the sfg_prod schema
on mysql.

The application should be built using the default profile. Otherwise the tests will fail.

for mysql setup:
  key files: 
  	configure-mysql.sql - this file drops all schemas and associated users and then rebuilds them and set CRUD grants.
  	guru_database_create.sql.  this file is generated by hibernate. After it is created by hibernate it needs some cleanup before
  		you can use it.  i.e. ";" after each command etc.  The contents of this file should be copied into workbench where the schema 
  		can be built.  This file is generated by properties property in the yml file. look at remarked out propert in application-dev.yml. 
  		After it has been run, you should remark the the code since it should not be needed again.   
  	#properties:  open this up to enable schema generation.  Then remark out. validation should now work.
